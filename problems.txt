Problem 1:
Students and people living in West Campus need better access to fresh food and groceries, because the only ways to get groceries are to use grocery delivery, take the bus, or have access to a car. As a result, students with less money or time have a harder time saving money and being healthy because they canâ€™t access fresh groceries.

Problem 2:
Students in West Campus with cars need a better way to find available parking spaces, both in the short term and long term, because it is very difficult to find parking spots that are both cheap and close to where a student lives.
